# California Housing Price Prediction

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build and evaluate machine learning models to predict housing prices in California. 
We use Linear Regression for a simple baseline model and Random Forest for a more complex model.
Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize the Random Forest model's performance.
